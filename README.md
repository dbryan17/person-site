page layout:

two types:

all titles are has-text-success

hero (large text optional subtitle):

- defaults to 3 rem padding on top and bottom of heading

smaller title:

- use "title" class and is-size-4
  : defaults to 0 rem padding top, so need outer container with class "pageContNonHero", has 2 rem padding bottom

page-chunk is area of page they have padding bottom of 1.5 rem
each page chunk is an area of text or picutures, if it has a line under it (<hr>) it should have inner-page-chunk with has padding-bottom 1 rem, then hr has 2 rem margin on either side
