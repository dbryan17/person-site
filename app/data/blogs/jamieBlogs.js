I recently started reading a new book series to break up mundanity and it was fantastic, so, I offer this review to break up the more serious blogs on this website and hope it can be a similar respite. Many moons ago, Dakota started his newest quest by picking up an absolute brick of a novel: %%i{The Way of Kings} by Brandon Sanderson. Sitting at 1300 pages, this was the largest book I'd ever seen and I doubted my friend’s commitment to such a novel. I was proven wrong as time ticked by though, his book-mark slowly, but steadily, weaved its way through the dense mound of pages. Then seemingly out of nowhere, jumped the last 200 pages in one sitting and my friend was raving about how utterly amazing the end of this book was.%%n
As Dakota moved onto the next book in the series, %%i{The Way of Kings} sat where he finished it. Collecting dust. But as my previous literary affair came to an end, its bright cover and swollen spine sat there in challenge. A whole lotta book for little ol’ me. But boredom and Dakota’s prodding wore me down. What ensued was a month-long obsession. The action filled prologue instantly hooked me, and I was enamored until the very last page in the Appendix. I would sit outside every single lunch break and just read. Despite many claiming this book as mostly set up, I left completely satisfied. I will not spoil anything in this review so fret not dear reader, but I will rave about Sanderson’s mastery of storytelling.%%n
In another author’s hands there’s a good chance I never would have gotten through that many pages. With Sanderson though, the writing is easy to read and to visualize. He is incredibly generous with repeating important information, so there is no need to analyze each chapter to figure out the way a certain currency works, or where each character is. It also paints some of the most memorable scenes in my mind of any series. It’s written in a way where our characters really %%i{feel} like they are in the world, and Sanderson perfectly walks the line of describing the world without letting adjectives bog down the narrative. And what a richly imagined world it is. Unique weather patterns, creatures, and fauna make balanced ecosystems. The varied cultures interactions have believable prejudices and make sense based on the world’s history. That’s not to mention the world of magic, sprits, and layers to reality that is only hinted at. %%n
This book has three main character’s, whose varied backgrounds provide unique lenses to view this world. I loved being introduced to our main character through the eyes of another, and I think it’s an easy way to come to understand him from an external perspective before shifting into his shoes. While he’s fighting to survive, another character is a young scholar; whose journey through education asks questions with surprising philosophical depth, applicable to both the world of Roshar and our own. We also follow a general who seeks to understand leadership off the battlefield, trying to redefine himself to the world, his family, and to himself. These three journeys nicely compliment and reflect each other’s struggles, giving a feeling of connection despite being in very different places.%%n
I’d say the biggest struggle this book has is pacing. What it lacks in excitement for a good ¾ of the novel however, it makes up for with a fascinating world and countless questions. With first installments to long series I often feel writers fall into the JJ Abrams mystery box trap, writing 1300 pages of questions with the assumption they can be answered down the line. Sanderson doesn’t do that here. Yes, there are still some questions by the end, but nearly all of the questions posed by the plot are satisfyingly answered. This leaves a solid foundation that the rest of the series can build on with creativity, unhampered by questions and loose threads. That being said, the pacing does make it tough to get through. The book tries hard to make the main character’s story the one you care about the most, which certainly works, but I felt his arc was used to drag the slower plot lines along. This worked to get me to push through the other stuff as quickly as possible, but could lose a lot of people in the process.%%n
So yeah, this book was not perfect, although for the last 200 pages alone I could recommend it to most. It also has one of the best sequels. If you are bored, and if you are reading this I can only assume you must be, give %%i{The Way of Kings} a shot. Who knows, you might also read the last 100 pages at your work desk because you simply can’t think of anything else.`,
