  I am sick of having a conversation with someone just for them to brag about their dog. I get it, you love your dog and think they’re the best dog in the world. Every dog owner feels the same way and there's nothing wrong with it. I feel that way about my dog who is fat, spoiled, and sleeps till noon. These are traits that aren’t glamorous, they are not special, and almost any organism is capable of doing what Mortimer does. Do I feel as if he’s not the best dog in the world? No, he is to me. But I’m not going to go around claiming I have the greatest dog ever. Unless your pooch has won Westminster five years in a row I don’t want to hear its name in the same conversation as greatness. But it happens, people don’t actually mean it, and I should not be taking something so simple so seriously, right? In most cases yeah, but when someone hypes their dog up so much only to show me a picture of a glorified sewer rat, then I draw a thick line in the sand.%%n
	These things are gross, and mean, and don’t deserve to breathe the same air as real dogs. Ok ok, maybe that's a bit extreme. I take that back actually, I don’t wish death on anything or feel as if certain beings don't deserve to live. But holy shit do these dogs come close. What the fuck is the point of getting one of these things? I feel like the only justification to have one of these creatures is if you’re Paris Hilton and you need something small to swing around in your purse. Stop acting like these are great family dogs, or get along super well with children because we know you’re lying. There is not one person alive who genuinely believes these rodents are little angels. I’m not saying don’t own one or you should hate your dog, people like what they like, and that’s ok. What’s not ok though, is acting like your little piece of shit is the Nelson Mandela of dogs. %%n
	Now you might be reading this and thinking, “But Henry, this goes beyond having an opinion. You’re just being hateful towards something that you don’t like.” Which is a fair assessment of my writing up to this point. Hate is a strong word though… which is exactly why I’m going to use it. I hate these dogs. Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself again, that’s a joke I don’t actually hate them. I’ve had some very pleasant experiences with small dogs. Pomerainians, Yorkies, Shih Tzus, Pugs, and a cast of others are all great small dogs. I can’t hate, I enjoy the majority of those dogs.  So it’s important to note this post isn’t about them. All of the words above only really apply to three dog breeds. Toy poodles, Maltese, and Chihuahuas. Fuck em. For the most part, I mean. I knew a Chihuahua who was a very sweet and silly dog. All the others I could care less about. Again I don’t hate these dogs, I don’t want them to die or anything crazy like that, I am just sick of the righteousness that exudes from their owners. My issue may have to do more with their owners than the actual dogs, but that’s another story. Also one bit me on the bus last week and I looked into its little eyes and said “I am going to expose you to the world.” So here’s to “Pebbles” and her incompetent owner, without you this fire would have never been ignited.

  title: "A Look At The Capital Punishment Issue",
  author: "Henry Piedra",
  date: "May 27th, 2024",
  content: `
  A hot-button issue in the US for as long as I’ve been alive is capital punishment. If you are reading this and have no idea what capital punishment is, look it up. I’m not here to explain anything to you. Actually, I will. But, just this one time. Capital Punishment in my rough archaic definition is: when state governments decide someone's crime is so heinous, that the only fair punishment is to kill them. And honestly, when I put it like that, I start to think of some pretty awful people in history who never had to answer for their crimes. Shiro Ishii, Idi Amin, OJ, would the world be any better if they were put to death after the acts they committed? I guess that’s where the argument lies. Why are people inveigled so heavily to either side of this argument? I’ve never really read or heard of someone who’s “on the fence” when it comes to gassing people that governments have claimed to be evil, but what do I really know?  As long as humans walk the earth, some will be against this procedure and others will always be for it. But, what if I told you that many people suggest a solution that would “totally work” to solve this issue?%%n
	Imagine the America we live in today in a separate timeline. Everything is the same: historical events, the Jets being a pathetic franchise, and Marjorie Taylor Greene (allegedly) eating children every Sunday, all truths we have today in our country. These truths don’t go anywhere in this timeline, the only thing that’s truly different is capital punishment. Instead of state governments deciding what happens to evil-doers in this, what if the choice was entirely left up to the people? What if through mass voting the destiny of convicted killers was chosen by the public? In my writings I don’t make a lot of sense, I’m rarely genuine about things, and usually, I’m just trying to amuse myself, but I am going to be serious for a moment here.%%n
In 2007 one of the most evil acts this country has ever seen was committed in the state of Connecticut. In the middle of the night, two men broke into a family of four home in Chesire. The men brutally beat the father with a baseball bat, assaulted and killed an eleven-year-old girl, then doused the remaining two family members in gasoline, and burned them alive.  All that was left afterward was a grieving father and a pile of ash. Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were apprehended and sentenced to death by the state in 2011. Their execution dates were set for the following year but due to appeals were heavily delayed. Then in the summer of 2015, the state of Connecticut abolished the death penalty, and the two were subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This was a hot-button topic in the state, as many believed these two deserved to die, while others believed that spending the rest of their days in prison was a justifiable punishment.%%n
I’m not going to throw my hat in the ring because I don’t stand one way or another. But what is interesting to imagine is a world where the people of New Haven county, and the state as a whole, voted on the outcome of the two. If I had to take an educated guess I’d say it would come close, but specifically in a state where horrifying acts are somewhat of a rarity, it may be safe to assume they would no longer be alive in this scenario. Would this be true democracy in action? How would it be possible to know that the public wasn’t making emotional rash votes when deciding the fate of two murderers? I don’t think it is. Unless there was a provided period of thought for the public, a timeframe in which emotions can settle, and rational choices could be made. Would this be a world you’d want to live in? Where the lives of people are truly in the hands of the public? Some disagree with the death penalty because they believe the only person to make this choice is God, others just don’t find it humane, and of course, some people just don’t understand solving violence with more violence. Which is why in this fantasy world at least they’d also have a say.%%n
I think the fear of living in a reality like the one I present is the fear of things going too far. Capital punishment slowly becoming a form of entertainment and a place for advertising, and at that point, the country would lack far more humanity than it already does. I’m not the first person to present this idea of mass voting, many people suggest this online whenever they read about nefarious people. I think the difference is I don’t necessarily think it’s a good idea. Imagine it gets to the point where some guy walks into a coffee shop and kills three people, injuring seven. He’s apprehended and it's put to a vote for the death penalty. Imagine the family members of the victims looking for proper vindication for what has been done. Then the guy ends up on a pay-per-view where they shoot him out of a cannon into the Atlantic, and the whole event’s sponsored by Redbull. They do slow-motion replays, he’s wearing a cape for some reason, then you have it sped up and high-pitched, and eventually his execution becomes the next big meme on TikTok. At that point do you still consider it justice?%%n
I think I know this country decently, and I believe in my whole heart that using this method would end up being a way to make money, to the point where all common decency is lost. Do I have a list of people that I want to be shot into the sun? Yeah. Would I pay to see it? Also yeah. But, I don’t want to live in a world where that’s reality. I think the notion of leaving the death penalty up to the people is a fine idea in theory. But whenever I think about it, things always seem to end the same way. I’m not going to sit here and bash the things I hate about capitalism. However, what I will say is, as someone who’s lived in its system for so long, do you really believe that things wouldn’t end with someone about to die for their crimes, wearing a Jimmy Johns sponsorship patch? I’m not going to give answers here, I’m just looking into an idea I’ve heard before. And while I think it makes some sense in theory, I think in practice you’ll end up with consumerist bullshit. At the end of the day in this theorized world it should just be up to the families of the victims, but what right do they really have? It’s human nature to see something horrible and want immediate action, but at a certain point, it’s not your call to make.%%n
Twenty-seven states in the US still have the death penalty. Meanwhile, an estimated fifty-five percent of Americans support capital punishment, and even though that is the second lowest support of it since 1972, that percentage is still massive. You can still die by firing squad in five states, the electric chair is allowed in five states as well, but shooting people out of cannons has never been an approved method of execution, so who knows what the fuck’s going on anymore. All I can say for certain is this issue is never going to go away, especially not in my lifetime. But years after I’m gone (if I have to estimate I’d say by 2056), I hope that there won’t be a streaming service for executions, but there always could be.
