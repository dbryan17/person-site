I am sick of having a conversation with someone just for them to brag about their dog. I get it, you love your dog and think they’re the best dog in the world. Every dog owner feels the same way and there's nothing wrong with it. I feel that way about my dog who is fat, spoiled, and sleeps till noon. These are traits that aren’t glamorous, they are not special, and almost any organism is capable of doing what Mortimer does. Do I feel as if he’s not the best dog in the world? No, he is to me. But I’m not going to go around claiming I have the greatest dog ever. Unless your pooch has won Westminster five years in a row I don’t want to hear its name in the same conversation as greatness. But it happens, people don’t actually mean it, and I should not be taking something so simple so seriously, right? In most cases yeah, but when someone hypes their dog up so much only to show me a picture of a glorified sewer rat, then I draw a thick line in the sand. 
	These things are gross, and mean, and don’t deserve to breathe the same air as real dogs. Ok ok, maybe that's a bit extreme. I take that back actually, I don’t wish death on anything or feel as if certain beings don't deserve to live. But holy shit do these dogs come close. What the fuck is the point of getting one of these things? I feel like the only justification to have one of these creatures is if you’re Paris Hilton and you need something small to swing around in your purse. Stop acting like these are great family dogs, or get along super well with children because we know you’re lying. There is not one person alive who genuinely believes these rodents are little angels. I’m not saying don’t own one or you should hate your dog, people like what they like, and that’s ok. What’s not ok though, is acting like your little piece of shit is the Nelson Mandela of dogs. 
	Now you might be reading this and thinking, “But Henry, this goes beyond having an opinion. You’re just being hateful towards something that you don’t like.” Which is a fair assessment of my writing up to this point. Hate is a strong word though… which is exactly why I’m going to use it. I hate these dogs. Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself again, that’s a joke I don’t actually hate them. I’ve had some very pleasant experiences with small dogs. Pomerainians, Yorkies, Shih Tzus, Pugs, and a cast of others are all great small dogs. I can’t hate, I enjoy the majority of those dogs.  So it’s important to note this post isn’t about them. All of the words above only really apply to three dog breeds. Toy poodles, Maltese, and Chihuahuas. Fuck em. For the most part, I mean. I knew a Chihuahua who was a very sweet and silly dog. All the others I could care less about. Again I don’t hate these dogs, I don’t want them to die or anything crazy like that, I am just sick of the righteousness that exudes from their owners. My issue may have to do more with their owners than the actual dogs, but that’s another story. Also one bit me on the bus last week and I looked into its little eyes and said “I am going to expose you to the world.” So here’s to “Pebbles” and her incompetent owner, without you this fire would have never been ignited.
